## Hiya!

**Who am I?**

I'm a math PhD student and teaching assistant at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid. My advisor is [Andrei Jaikin-Zapirain](https://andreijaikin.wordpress.com/). Keywords for my work are: profinite and pro-p groups, completed group algebras, Sylvester rank functions, semisimple Lie group representations. I'm also interested in low dimensional topology and number theory. My hair is currently [this color]{.hair-color}. You can find my email at the footer of the page.
